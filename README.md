# Deploying the E-commerce Micro services Project on EC2

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the E-commerce Micro service project on an EC2 instance using Nginx.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and Linux commands.

## Step 1: Create EC2 instance (AWS Linux 2023) 

1. Create EC2 instance using the below user data
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install docker -y
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    newgrp docker
    systemctl start docker
    systemctl enable docker

    ```
2. Enable http (80) port for everyone on security groups
1. Obtain the SSH key pair associated with your EC2 instance.
2. Connect to the instance using SSH:
    ```
    ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip-or-dns>
    ```

## Step 2: Download the code, build docker image, run container

1. Clone the repository containing the E-commerce Microservices project:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mariusforreal/ecommerce-micro-service-web.git
    ```

2. Change directory to the project:
    ```
    cd ecommerce-micro-services
    ```
3. Build docker image:
    ```
    docker build -t web-image .
    ```
4. Run docker image:
    ```
    docker run -d -p 80:80 web-image
    ```

## Step 3: Access the website
3. Open a web browser and navigate to your EC2 instance's public IP or DNS.
4. You should see the E-commerce micro services project served by Nginx.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the E-commerce micro services project on an EC2 instance with Nginx. You can now access the project through Nginx.
